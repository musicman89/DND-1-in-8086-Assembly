# DND-1-in-8086-Assembly
A Port of Richard Garriott's DND #1 in Pure 8086 Assembly

This is a port from the original version of this game to bootable 8086 Assembly Code.  The goal is to make a version of this game that will work on any computer from 1978 forward that has a x86 processor.  Since the game is bootable it is independant of any operating system, and since there is no hardward acceleration it is not dependant on specific hardware.

Currently I am still in development of the game, but I hope to have a beta ready in a couple of weeks.
